# Automated-OMR-validation-inbuilt-databse
* Objective :To propose an OMR automated evaluation system with a database setup which can evaluate and detect the register number and mark for the omr sheet and store the register number and mark in the database .
* Already there are different types of methods that can evaluate the omr type answer sheets but they only evaluate and display the grade or results . They never store them anywhere. So the results must be stored manually but this takes a huge amount of time . So to reduce the time taken for storing the results we come up with a solution of creating an omr automated evaluation system that can evaluate the OMR answer sheet with the help of a webcam by using the image detection technique and also to detect the register number of candidate in the OMR sheet using OPENCV with an inbuilt database setup. After detecting and evaluating the OMR sheet the register number and mark is to be stored in a database with the help of sqlite3
